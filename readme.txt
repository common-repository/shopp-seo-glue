Allows the WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast and the Shopp e-commerce plugin by Ingenesis to work in something approaching sweet harmony.

== Description ==

Ensuring your online store is visible to search engines is an understandably high priority for most online merchants. Unfortunately
some compatibility issues have been reported regarding Shopp and WordPress SEO. This plugin acts as a compatibility or "glue" layer,
helping to bind the two plugins together so that Shopp users can benefit from WordPress SEO's functionality across their store and
not just on pages and posts.

*You might not require this plugin.* A number of people report no problems whatsoever using WordPress SEO and Shopp, so give them a
whirl and see if they work without this plugin first of all. If you can see a metabox on the product editor screen, labelled
"WordPress SEO by Yoast" then you can sit back and relax.

The current version of Shopp SEO Glue was built against:

*   WordPress 3.4.1
*   Shopp 1.2.3
*   WordPress SEO 1.2.5

No other configurations have been tested and this plugin will not work (and anyway should not be required) if you are using the old 1.1 branch
of Shopp.

== Installation ==

Either upload the zipped plugin archive usingthe Add New Plugin screen in WordPress, or unzip and upload the shoppseoglue so that it resides
within your wp-content/plugins directory ... then activate! This plugin does not generate any new admin screens or anything else - it simply
mediates between Shopp and WordPress SEO - both of which must of course be installed and activated first of all.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I customize product categories? =

Currently Shopp SEO Glue does not do anything to manage this aspect. It may be added in the future.

= The snippet preview URL is wrong! =

Yes it is. This is a known bug that will hopefully be resolved soon.

== Screenshots ==

What no screenshots?!

Shopp SEO Glue doesn't actually generate any output itself. It just helps WordPress SEO and Shopp to play nicely - they do all the heavy
lifting.
